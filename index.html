        Dear Terminal Users,<br><br>

        I want to start off by saying thank you. Thanks for being a part of the Terminal community and helping us grow to where we've come. You may have noticed during the last several months, you've seen less and less activity from our staff. From development side of things, to even our support side, our operations have slown. <br><br>

        We've focused on other projects and just have been super busy, and that has sadly driven us to slow down on our business and operations side. Our revenue has slowed significantly, and our teams time to respond to this and try to improve and grow the product had decreased as well.<br><br>

        We are highly motivated to produce a state of the art CAD system. For the next few months, our development team is going to focus completely on the development of TerminalCAD, a new and improved Terminal.<br><br>

        For now, all operations on Terminal are ceasing. We are officially closing our doors, and shutting down all operations.<br><br>

        Effective immediately, our domain, and subdomain, are deactivated and turned off. Terminal, and Afterthought System, are fully offline and no longer operational. Afterthought System, LLC has been legally dissolved.<br><br>

        Any subscribers who are currently in the middle of a plan, you will be refunded for the remaining time on the plan.<br><br>

        If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this email or send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@afterthought-system.com">support@afterthought-system.com</a>.<br><br>


        Thanks for everything,<br>
        Drake Dussault<br>
        Chief Executive Officer<br>
        Terminal, a division of Afterthought System, LLC
